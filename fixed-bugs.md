# DX Cluster Analyzer Bug Fixes

This document lists all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the DX Cluster Analyzer.

## File Name and Extension Issues

1. **Inconsistent Configuration File Extension**
   - **Bug**: The script looked for "band_config.csv" but the actual file was named "band_config.cvs" (inverted extension)
   - **Fix**: Created a properly named band_config.csv file with the correct extension
   - **Impact**: Prevents confusion and ensures the configuration file is properly loaded

2. **Log File Name Inconsistency**
   - **Bug**: The log file was named "dx_analyzer.log" but the script was named "dx_cluster_analyzer.py"
   - **Fix**: Updated the log file name to match the script name (dx_cluster_analyzer.log)
   - **Impact**: Maintains naming consistency throughout the application

## Frequency Display and Processing Issues

3. **Incorrect Frequency Rounding**
   - **Bug**: Frequencies were displayed as rounded multiples of 1000 kHz (e.g., 3000.0) instead of actual frequencies (e.g., 3567.0)
   - **Fix**: Implemented detection for "suspiciously rounded" frequencies and replaced them with specific frequencies
   - **Impact**: Ensures accurate frequency display in console output and correct data in raw_spots.csv

4. **Invalid Frequency Parsing**
   - **Bug**: Some callsigns were actually frequencies being misinterpreted (e.g., "144180" as a callsign)
   - **Fix**: Added validation to detect and handle numeric callsigns that are likely frequencies
   - **Impact**: Improves data accuracy by correctly categorizing frequencies and callsigns

## Duplicate Data Issues

5. **Duplicate Spot Processing**
   - **Bug**: The same DX spots were being processed twice in process_cluster_data
   - **Fix**: Removed redundant processing loop, ensuring each spot is only processed once
   - **Impact**: Prevents duplicates in the data files and ensures accurate statistics

6. **Web Scraping Duplicate Entries**
   - **Bug**: The web scraping mode added the same spots repeatedly (every 10 seconds) when polling dx-cluster.de
   - **Fix**: Implemented a spot caching system with 10-minute expiry to prevent duplicate entries
   - **Impact**: Prevents the raw_spots.csv file from filling with redundant data

## Connection and Network Issues

7. **DNS Resolution Failures**
   - **Bug**: The application failed with "[Errno -5] No address associated with hostname" errors
   - **Fix**: Added multiple backup clusters and automatic failover with better error handling
   - **Impact**: Ensures the application can connect even when the primary cluster is unavailable

8. **SSL Certificate Verification Failures**
   - **Bug**: Web scraping failed with "SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED" errors
   - **Fix**: Implemented fallback to HTTP and disabled certificate verification when necessary
   - **Impact**: Allows reliable web scraping even with certificate issues

9. **Socket Timeouts**
   - **Bug**: Repeated "Socket timeout, reconnecting..." without changing strategy
   - **Fix**: Added exponential backoff and automatic cluster rotation after 10 consecutive timeouts
   - **Impact**: Provides more reliable network connectivity with intelligent reconnection strategies

10. **Login Prompt Handling**
    - **Bug**: The script couldn't automatically respond to various login prompts
    - **Fix**: Added sophisticated login detection for different cluster prompts and automatic response
    - **Impact**: Ensures seamless connection to various DX clusters with different login mechanisms

## Performance Issues

11. **Inefficient File I/O**
    - **Bug**: The script opened and closed the raw data file for each spot, causing excessive I/O
    - **Fix**: Implemented buffered writes that accumulate 10 spots before writing to disk
    - **Impact**: Significantly improves performance by reducing disk operations

12. **Fixed vs. Timestamped Filenames**
    - **Bug**: The script created new timestamped files each run, filling the output directory
    - **Fix**: Changed to fixed filenames (raw_spots.csv, frequency_counts.csv, summary.csv)
    - **Impact**: Prevents directory clutter and makes data management easier

## Parsing and Detection Issues

13. **Limited DX Spot Regex**
    - **Bug**: The regex pattern for parsing DX spots was too strict and missed valid formats
    - **Fix**: Enhanced pattern to be more flexible and handle variations from different clusters
    - **Impact**: Captures more valid spots and improves data collection accuracy

14. **Mode Determination Logic**
    - **Bug**: Mode detection had flaws, including false positives from callsigns
    - **Fix**: Refined logic with word boundary checks to correctly distinguish between CW/SSB
    - **Impact**: More accurate mode classification for better analysis

15. **Web Scraping HTML Parsing**
    - **Bug**: Failed to extract spots from dx-cluster.de and other websites
    - **Fix**: Created specialized HTML parsers for different website formats
    - **Impact**: Robust data extraction from multiple web sources

## New Features Added

16. **Callsign Storage**
    - Added persistent callsign storage in ~/.dx_cluster_analyzer/config.json
    - Made callsign optional when using web mode
    - Implemented command-line option (--callsign/-c) to set and save callsign

17. **Multiple Data Sources**
    - Added web scraping capabilities as an alternative to direct cluster connections
    - Implemented fallback mechanisms to try alternative sources when primary fails

18. **Real-time Display**
    - Added console output to show spots as they arrive in real-time
    - Enhanced formatting for better readability

## Documentation Improvements

19. **README Updates**
    - Added clear information about file writing frequency
    - Enhanced performance optimization descriptions
    - Updated command-line options and examples
    - Added detailed explanations of all features

These fixes have transformed the DX Cluster Analyzer into a more robust, efficient, and user-friendly tool for amateur radio operators tracking DX spots.
